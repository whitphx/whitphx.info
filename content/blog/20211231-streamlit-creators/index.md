[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is hosting [the Creators program](https://streamlit.io/creators) and invites some community members to it due to their contributions.

A few months after I released my first OSS related to Streamlit, [`streamlit-webrtc`](https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc), and posted [an article about it](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/new-component-streamlit-webrtc-a-new-way-to-deal-with-real-time-media-streams/8669) at the community forum on January 2021, I got an invitation for the membership!

As written in the page, if you become a member of it,
* they give you original swag!
* they invite you to internal hackathon events!
* they invite you to internal meetings!

I actually received the swag this month ðŸ˜ƒ

I also participated in the hackathon and developed [`streamlit-fesion`](https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-fesion) in the event. It is a prototype of a Streamlit custom component that uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html) to run Python code on the client-side to process webcam video streams.
