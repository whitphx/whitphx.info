I have rebranded my OSS product [Stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite). For the details about the project itself, see [this post](../20221104-streamlit-wasm-stlite/).

## Changes

* Capitalized the first letter of its name, "*stlite*" -> "*Stlite*"
    * "stlite" was hard to recognize as a proper noun or a product name.
* Changed the short description from "*Serverless Streamlit*" to "*In-browser Streamlit*"
    * "Serverless" was vague as it could be interpreted as "serverless computing" like AWS Lambda.
* Created a new logo
    * I made the old one by myself at the beginning of the project. Now it's worth paying for a professional design.
    * I used [99designs](https://99designs.jp/) and held a [competition](https://99designs.jp/social-media-pack/contests/modern-geometric-logo-cutting-edge-open-source-software-1292989/entries) to get a new logo.

I made [this issue](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite/issues/1009) for the rebranding discussion.
