_Updated:_ [How do I ask a good question? - Help Center - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) has already explained almost all things this article says.

# Objective

This article explains some things you should know when asking programming problems such as "X is not working" or "What's this error?".

- This article mainly explains superficial and formal techniques that make the questions readable and likely to get responses.
- This article is NOT focusing on soft skills or moral advice like "be polite."

# The most important idea

The principle is to pay as much effort as possible to save the respondents' time and effort to understand and solve the problem.

The problem-solving process they may do includes, for example,

- reproducing the bug in their own environment by running the actual code
- reading the logs
- googling the error messages

# Things to do and not to do

So, you should be aware of the following things to support solving the problem.

- Do research and try possible solutions by yourself beforehand as much as possible, and post the progress and results.
  - Information such as "I tried X but it didn't work" or "I think Y may be the related topic, but couldn't find a clear answer" is a good starting point for problem solving.
  - Incidentally, such your effort motivates respondents. People want to support those who pay efforts.
- Do provide all the information for the respondents to reproduce the problem.
  - It includes, but is not limited to, source code, assets, and/or environment information.
  - Think whether it's possible to run the code and encounter the same problem from zero only with the information you post?
  - If the amount is huge, consider to
    - upload them to GitHub and post the link.
    - create a shorter code snippet that reproduces the same problem and post it.
- Do share the background or the high-level requirements.
  - Why do you want to solve this problem? What do you want build after solving the problem? What kind of software/product are you developing?
  - Such information is sometimes much important rather than the specific error description itself. Do not omit it just by your decision.
- Do format the source code and the logs.
  - For example, if Markdown can be used in the forum, put ` ``` ` (three backticks) surrounding the code or logs[^1].
  - Markdown can be used in many web forums. Learn Markdown syntax. You have to use at least code blocks. See https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks.
  - Non-formatted code and logs are very hard to read.
- Don't post the source code or the logs as screenshots.
  - They cannot be copied to the clipboard. It takes much effort to run the code or google the logs. It's so annoying.
- Do paste the images or the screenshots if you have visual results related to the problem.

I will be adding the list items. If you have ideas to add to the list, please let me know [through Twitter](https://twitter.com/whitphx) or by [creating GitHub Issues](https://github.com/whitphx/whitphx.info/issues) or [Pull Requests](https://github.com/whitphx/whitphx.info/pulls).

[^1]: Precisely, the code block with ` ``` ` is an extended Markdown syntax, such as [GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Anyway, many web forums are supporting it.
