**YES‚úÖ**

## Different from academia

**Unlike academic conferences and journals**, it is common to submit the same talk proposal to multiple PyCon held in different countries/places **simultaneously**.

For other tech conferences, I have neither participated in nor submitted a talk proposal, so I don't know the situation. You should check the conference's website or ask the organizer or experienced people around you.

## My case

In 2022, I presented a talk titled "Real-time browser-ready computer vision apps with Streamlit" at [EuroPython 2022](https://ep2022.europython.eu/) and [PyCon APAC 2022](https://tw.pycon.org/2022/).
This time, I first submitted the talk proposal to [PyCon US 2022](https://us.pycon.org/2022/), then before the result came out, I submitted the same talk proposal to EuroPython and PyCon APAC as well.
Because it was my first time to submit a talk proposal to PyCon, I was not sure if it was OK to submit the same talk proposal to multiple PyCon, so I asked the EuroPython and PyCon APAC organizers via e-mails. **Then they said it was OK**.

After I entered the PyCon sphere, I found that **it is actually common**. Many people do this, and it is sometimes a good strategy for them to make travel to many countries! (See my related postüëâ [Conf-driven Traveling‚úàÔ∏è](../20230511-conference-driven-travels/)).

I wrote this post because I couldn't find any information clearly answering this question on the Internet.

In 2023, I actually submitted the same talk proposal to multiple PyCon and it was accepted by [PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2023](https://2023.pycon.de/program/GYEZVW/), [PyCon LT](https://pretalx.com/pycon-lt-2023/talk/3BQCJW/), [PyCon TW](https://tw.pycon.org/2023/en-us/conference/talk/301), and [PyCon APAC](https://2023-apac.pycon.jp/timetable?id=YTGKPT)üéâ
